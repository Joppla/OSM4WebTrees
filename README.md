# OSM4WebTrees
Module for [WebTrees](http://webtrees.net) to show genealogical location data on on [OpenStreetMap](openstreetsmap.org) tiles, and displayed via [Leaflet](leafletjs.com).

## Requirements
This module requires and is tested with WebTrees 1.7.9. It should work with all 1.7.x versions.

For now, this module relies a bit on the Google Maps module. In the future, the plan is to remove that requirement.

## Installation
### via zip/tarball
Download the plugin, based on your webtrees version, and unpack it into `webtrees/modules_v3/OSM4WebTrees`

Feel free to open a PR with any changes you'd like to make to this plugin. I don't have a whole lot of time to devote to this, but I will definitely review (and probably merge) any PRs in a timely manner.
